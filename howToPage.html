            <p>The bishops are invading and we need your help to stop them!</p>
            <p>Use your mouse to click on any bishops that are
                thrown your way! You need to be quick though because
                you'll only have 45 seconds to defeat as many bishops
                as you can!</p>
            <p> Good luck! </p>
